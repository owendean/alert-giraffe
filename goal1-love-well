Some time ago there were no people. 
Then, after more time, people came into existence.
It is all very well and good that people exist.
Overall, people are a very good contribution to everything else that exists.
In the present, at the time of the writing of this commit, there are many people on the planet (more than there have been in the past).
I am just one of the many people.
I hope to do the very best that I can with the rest of the limited time that I am alotted here.
Love seems to be the best way to do the best that I can with the time that I have.
I hope that I am able to love well for the remainder of my life.
