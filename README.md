hello-world
Owen here. I am a beginner Data Scientist / Software Engineer. 
This is my first GitHub branch and commit.
I am thankful for this forum to be able to 
collaborate with others on projects. I hope
that my friends are willing to learn GitHub
so that we can work with one-another to make
influential projects together. Many thanks to the GitHub designers.
